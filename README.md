This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Bookshelf
This project has frontend and server folder. Please follow the instruction for proper setup, especially for the server.

# Server
In order for the project to run you need to copy the `data.json` file into data folder inside server,
which can be found here as well. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sOzHYVbxNIGRDUIDZX-zB8yoiwyFOPdm/view

When this is done, cd into server and run `npm install` and `npm start`. This will start the api and you can focus on the frontend. Please don't stop running the server.

# Frontend
Cd into frontend and run `npm install` and `npm start`. To run test `npm run test`.
